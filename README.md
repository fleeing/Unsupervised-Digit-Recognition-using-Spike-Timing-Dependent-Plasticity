# Unsupervised-Digit-Recognition-using-Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity
This project aims doing unsupervised learning of digit recognition task using Spiking neural network and Spike timing Dependent Plasticity so as to bring the representation of neural network more towards how actually the brain works. This project is still under progress.
